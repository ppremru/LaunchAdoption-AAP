# Git 101: The Source of Truth for Automation

**Goal:** Establish a foundation for version control, collaboration, and safe experimentation.


### Key Concepts

#### The Repository

A Git repository, or "repo," is a storage space for your project files and their entire history of changes. It is the core element of the Git version control system, allowing you to track, manage, and collaborate on code over time.

* Local: This is the copy of the repository on your local workstation. It is where you do your work. 
* Remote: This is the copy on a central server (like GitHub) that acts as the source of truth. Git gives this server the default name origin so you can refer to it by a short name instead of a full URL.

####  Basic Workflow

This process describes moving work between the remote origin and your local workstation.

* Clone from remote to local
* Stage files on local
* Commit changes on local
* Push committed changes from local to remote

#### Basic Workflow + Branches

This process describes the basic branching.

* Upon initializing a repo, there is a main branch
* Releases (production) are from main branch
* When working, create a feature branch
* Do your work in the feature branch
* Push the feature branch
* Create a Pull request on the remote server
* Merge the changes from feature to main branch
* Delete Feature branch

## Sanity Check

While the guides provide full details, focus on understanding this core set of commands first. This is the basic workflow you will use every day.

| Command | What it does | Example / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `git clone [url]` | Creates a local copy of a remote repository on your computer. | `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git` |
| `git branch [name]` | Creates a new branch for you to work on. | `git branch feature/new-playbook` |
| `git switch [name]` | Switches your active working directory to the specified branch. | `git switch feature/new-playbook` (Replaces older `checkout` command) |
| `git status` | Shows you the current state of your repository (changed files, etc.). | You will use this constantly. |
| `git add [file]` | Stages a file, telling Git you want to include it in the next commit. | `git add .` (Stages all changed files) |
| `git commit -m "..."` | Saves a "snapshot" of your staged changes to the repository's history. | `git commit -m "Add new inventory file"` |
| `git pull` | Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them. | Keeps your local branch up-to-date. |
| `git push` | Uploads your local commits to the remote repository. | Shares your work with the team and AAP. |
