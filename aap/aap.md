# Enablement Recommendations: Ansible Automation Platform

## Goals

This topic is continuing with growing Ansible skills by focusing on use cases and introducing AAP as the runtime platform.

Given this approach, this topic is NOT covering installation nor day 2 operations of managing AAP.   More than likely, these topics are necessary for the team and will require a dive into the architecture and infrastructure.
