# About Our Community: Team Profiles

> Note: This will be defined in the Adoption CoP Kickoff Session.

For example, customize role-names used on the team:

1. System Administrators
2. Automation Developers
3. Product Owners / Project Leads

> Tip: A topic to address in the future is to develop a table of skills required or these profiles.
