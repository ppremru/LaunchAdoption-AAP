# Our Practice: Enablement Framework

Our framework consists of leaning into product adoption by curating onboarding topics that are specific to the needs of the team.   

## Product Adoption Sessions

The expectation is that the CoP (team) agrees to a set of collaborative sessions initially facilitated by a Red Hat Specialized Adoption Architect.  The goal of the sessions are *enablement* - they provide a bridge between hands-on training and product demos.  Guest speakers (SMEs) or team members might present topics for collaboration.   (This is *not* a replacement for independent nor RHLS *training*.)

### AAP Adoption Session Format

The sessions are expected to be a lunch and learn approach - less than an hour at a time and a cadence that is convenient for the team.

| Info | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Facilitator** | Red Hat Adoption Architect utilizing an online white board |
| **Frequency** | Bi-weekly, 1 hour per session (approx 6 sessions) |
| **Audience** | Project Team Members |
| **1-Hour Agenda** | Intro, Tech Presentation, Group Discussion, Retro |

**Agenda**:

* Introduction: Set the stage (5 min)
* Technical Presentation: Core topic presentation (20 min)
* Group Discussion: Apply topic to the team's mission (15 min)
* Retro/Next Steps: Key takeaways and topic planning for the subsequent session (5 min)

### AAP Adoption Enablement Roadmap

Depending on the team skill set, a sessions may one or many than milestones:

| Milestone # | Title                                           | Focus Area                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| 1           | **CoP Kickoff** | Collaborating & Agreeing on Goals, Cadence, & Member Commitment |
| 2           | **Practical Application** | Identifying Business Use Cases to Drive Value |
| 3           | **Fundamental Concepts** | Confirming Core Concepts (IaC, GitOps) & Tools (Git, YAML, VSCode) |
| 4           | **Ansible Building Blocks** | Authoring Automation with Playbooks & Collections |
| 5           | **Containerization Essentials** | Utilizing Containers with Podman & Image Registry |
| 6           | **AAP Architecture** | Navigating Execution Environments, Advanced Workflows & Repositories |
| 7           | **Scale Automation** | Building a Community of Excellence with Best Practices |

## Onboarding Material

Acknowledging diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and capabilities, team member enablement should be adaptable. This framework serves as a guide, not a rigid rule set.  Examples of enablement materials:

* Red Hat Learning Subscription (RHLS)
* Red Hat Hands-on Labs (no cost)
* Product Documentation
* Blog Posts
* eBooks
* YouTube

### Enablement Maturity

Given the diverse skills within the team, the adoption and enablement of the technology stack will evolve in a phased approach. Maturity stages include:

1. **Crawl**  
Initial exploration
2. **Walk**  
Initial experimentation, quick wins with product capabilities, domain specific solutions, developing good practices
3. **Run**  
Supporting production environment with troubleshooting, debugging, and minor modifications, developing and sharing good practices
4. **Optimizing**
Ongoing support of the production environment, encompassing cross-functional domains

### Bringing it all together

Completing structured courses, reading, experimentation and collaboration are essential to mastering the skills of the product stack.   The team needs time to absorb new information, skills, and tools. There's an initial learning phase, followed by a period of practice and refinement to achieve proficiency.  Approach:

1. **Red Hat Learning Subscriptions (RHLS)**  
RHLS courses offer structured, comprehensive Red Hat training with features like hands-on labs, instructor-led videos, and expert support, which are not typically found in no-cost materials.  
2. **Independent Learning**  
No cost materials offer foundational using a variety of media from blogs to videos to hands-on labs.
3. **Hands-on Exploration**  
A sandbox dedicated to development provides team members the freedom to innovate and experiment without consequences.
4. **Collaboration**  
Collaboration fosters peer-to-peer learning by regularly demonstrating experiments, problems, and solutions.
