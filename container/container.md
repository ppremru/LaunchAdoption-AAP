# Enablement Recommendations: Container 101

## Goals

The goal is to understand the concept of running an image (container).   Understand the basics of the following container management tools:

- Buildah
- Podman
- Quay Image Registry

> Note:  
> The reasoning behind building a basic understanding of container management - Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) heavily uses containers as a core part of its architecture.  It uses containers in two primary ways: for running automation and for deployment of the platform itself.
