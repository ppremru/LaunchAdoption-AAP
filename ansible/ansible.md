# Enablement Recommendations: Ansible 101

## Goals

Before using the Ansible Automation Platform, the enablement goal is to develop core ansible skills. To do this - start experimenting with ansible using RHLS structured courses and independent learning.  Do you have crawl-walk level of these skills:

- Write **Playbooks**, use **Roles**, **Collections**, understand **Modules**
- Develop your ansible command line **Troubleshooting** skills

---
> Note:  
> 1: The focus is on building core ansible skills using ansible-core, not AAP
> 2: These skills can be learned either with or without the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
> 3: [AAP topics](../aap/aap.md) are introduced in a different section along with use cases
