# Launch Adoption - AAP

Welcome! This repository serves as the entry point for our **Community of Practice (CoP) for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) developer enablement**.

From the Adoption point of view -- we aim to master the creation, management, and scaling of automation content within the Ansible Automation Platform. Our first step is to streamline the onboarding experience for team members that are either new to the project team or new to Ansible by curating tips and links which guide independent learning. Ultimately, the outcome of simplified user training and onboarding increases product adoption (maturity) for the team.

> *The CoP maintains a versioned set of living documents that provide recommendations - it will take a commitment of time and effort to cultivate this repository specifically for a team. Notice the entry point is automation developer, not installation, infrastructure management, nor day-to-day administration of the AAP environment itself.*

## About our CoP for AAP Enablement

Our **domain**, **community**, and **practices**:

| [Practice: Enablement Framework](./about/aboutPractice.md) | Explains our "Crawl, Walk, Run" model and session roadmap. |
| [Domain: Team Mission](./about/aboutDomain.md) | *To be defined in the CoP Kickoff Session.* |
| [Community: Team Profiles](./about/aboutCommunity.md) | *To be defined in the CoP Kickoff Session.* |

## Our Enablement Framework

Our Enablement Framework aligns **Onboarding Topics** with **Product Adoption Sessions**.

### Onboarding Topics

The **Onboarding Topics** are grouped into sections in order to support a crawl, walk, run approach to AAP enablement.

| Topic | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Red Hat: Core Sites & Programs](./about/aboutRHResources.md) | :star: Key Red Hat resources (Customer Portal, Developer). |
| [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](./rhel/rhel.md) | Foundational RHEL skills (the "Control Plane" & "Target"). |
| [Foundational Concepts](./foundation/foundation.md) | Core tools and concepts (Git, YAML, VSCode, IaC). |
| [Ansible Building Blocks](./ansible/ansible.md) | Core Ansible skills (Playbooks, Roles, Inventory). |
| [Containerization Essentials](./container/container.md) | Container skills (Podman, Buildah) for Execution Environments. |
| [Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)](./aap/aap.md) | The platform (Controller, Workflows, Hub) that runs it all. |

### Product Adoption Sessions

The **Product Adoption Sessions** provide the team with a roadmap to increase AAP Enablement. It is expected that the sessions are facilitated by a Red Hat Adoption Specialist Architect. The community (team) should agree upon a set of collaborative sessions to align the community and domain -- and keep a log of events.

Refer to our [Practice Framework](./about/aboutPractice.md) for details. Here is a summary of recommended MILESTONES to drive sessions:

| MILESTONE # | Title | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **CoP Kickoff** | Collaborating & Agreeing on Goals, Cadence, & Member Commitment |
| 2 | **Practical Application** | Identifying Business Use Cases to Drive Value |
| 3 | **Fundamental Concepts** | Confirming Core Concepts (IaC, GitOps) & Tools (Git, YAML, VSCode) |
| 4 | **Ansible Building Blocks** | Authoring Automation with Playbooks & Collections |
| 5 | **Containerization Essentials** | Utilizing Containers with Podman & Image Registry |
| 6 | **AAP Architecture** | Navigating Execution Environments, Advanced Workflows & Repositories |
| 7 | **Scale Automation** | Building a Community of Excellence with Best Practices |
