# Launch Adoption - AAP

Welcome! This repository serves as the central hub for our  **Community of Practice (CoP) for AAP Enablement**. Our CoP goal is to streamline the onboarding experience for members that are either new to the project team or new to Ansible by curating tips and links which guide independent learning. Ultimately, the outcome of simplified user training and onboarding increases product adoption (maturity) for the team.

The CoP maintains a versioned set of *living documents* that provide recommendations - it will take time to cultivate for the team.
